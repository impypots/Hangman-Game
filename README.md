 Created the basic structure of the project today. Trying to figure out how to display underlines of the word the player is supposed to guess without allowing them to highlight the text and cheat. Actually unsure of several things, but I'm confident I can make some modicum of progress tomorrow.

 Made some progress with regards to how I'm going to display the correctly guessed letters of the secret word in an ordered fashion. Still kind of unsure on how I'm going to make that work. In the meantime, I made the hangman images, and set them up to change with each incorrect guess.
